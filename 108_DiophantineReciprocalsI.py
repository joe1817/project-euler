108 Diophantine Reciprocals I

In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1/x + 1/y = 1/n

For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

1/5 + 1/20 = 1/4
1/6 + 1/12 = 1/4
1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.

Observations

See https://mathematicalolympiads.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/an_introduction_to_diophantine_equations__a_problem_based_approach.pdf

The equation 1/x + 1/y = 1/n  is equivalent to (x-n)(y-n)=n^2. Each divisor d of n^2 suggests a solution: x-n = d and y-n = n^2/d (and then solve for x,y). So, the number of solution pairs (x,y) equals the number of divisors to n^2.

Since half of these solutions are just flipped versions of the other half (xâ†”y), you need to double the number of solutions you're looking for (>2000 instead of >1000). Note: There is exactly one solution where x=y.
