# project-euler
My solutions to [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Solved: 258

Highest Difficulty: 95% (Problem 768)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10
- numpy
- scipy
- primesieve

## Filename Conventions
- Files ending with *__REDO* are unsatisfactory (e.g., the code is ugly, the solution method is too brute-force, etc.)
- Files ending with *__SLOW* take much more than a minute to solve the problem. Implies *__REDO*.

## TODO
- Proof of correctness
- Time and space analysis
- Reduce lines of code (sort files by filesize)
