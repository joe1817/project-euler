235 An Arithmetic Geometric Sequence

Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)r^(k-1).
Let s(n) = Î£k=1...n u(k).

Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.

Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.

	***

Solution Method

Just increment digits one at a time and keep the highest that keeps the result above -6*10**11
'''

from decimal import Decimal as D

c = -6*10**11

def u(k, r):
	return (900-3*k)*r**(k-1)

def s(r, n = 5000):
	return sum( u(k, r) for k in range(1, n+1) )

base = "1." # easy to see r is between between 1 and 2
for digit_index in range(13):
	best_val = 0
	for val in range(10):
		num = D(base + str(val))
		if s(num) >= c:
			best_val = val
		else:
			break
	base = base + str(best_val)
	#print(base)

print(f"{float(base):.12f}")
#print(f"s({base}) = {s(D(base))}")
